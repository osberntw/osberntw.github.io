- Azerbaijan's High Referendum Activity highlights the constitutional referendum in 2016 with 29 individual amendments aimed at extending President Ilham Aliyevâ€™s term and enhancing his powers.
- Freedom House Ratings indicate that most Asian countries holding referendums are rated as "partly free" or "not free," suggesting these referendums often serve to legitimize authoritarian rulers.
- Taiwan as an Exception stands out as the most democratic country in Asia, holding the highest number of referendums on a broad range of issues, with further details on its referendum operations and outcomes to be discussed later.

# Referendums in Asia

- Many referendums in Asia are **controlled exercises ensuring outcomes that favor existing power structures**:
  - In nations like **Myanmar and Azerbaijan**, autocrats frequently use referendums to legitimize their governance.
- Varied but reserved use of referendum in Asian democracies
  - In **Japan and South Korea**, referendums are primarily reserved for constitutional changes, though local referendums address domestic issues.
  - In contrast, **Taiwan** uses referendums as tools for *direct democracy and enhancing citizen participation.*


<!--

# One country stands out: Taiwan 

- "Democratic" referendum in a democratic country


Here's a summarized bullet point version of the conclusion section:

Varied Usage in Asia: Referendums have been employed differently across Asian countries, reflecting the region's political diversity.
Autocratic Utilization: In countries with limited political freedom like Myanmar and Azerbaijan, referendums have often been used by autocrats to legitimize their rule.
Democratic Mechanism: In contrast, Taiwan uses referendums as tools for direct democracy and enhancing citizen participation.
Reserved Use in Democracies: In established democracies like Japan and South Korea, national referendums are primarily reserved for constitutional changes and are infrequent, though local referendums are common for addressing domestic issues.
Predetermined Outcomes: Generally, many referendums in Asia are seen as controlled exercises with predetermined outcomes favoring existing power structures, limiting genuine citizen impact.
Positive Examples: Despite challenges, examples from Japan and Taiwan show how referendums can empower citizens to address community issues and influence major policy decisions, providing useful models for other emerging democracies.

# Participation Effects on Democratic Satisfaction

## Dependent variables
1. Generally speaking, are you satisfied with the implementation of democracy in your country? (Performance)
2. If 1 stands for totally undemocratic and 10 stands for totally democratic, the smaller the score the more undemocratic it is, and the larger the score the more democratic it is. To which degree do you think Taiwan currently belongs? (Democracy Score)

## Independent variables
- Vote in 2021 referendum - first "independent" referendum from general election
- Demographical and partisan/"winning camp" control variables included
